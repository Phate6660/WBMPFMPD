# Web-Based Music Player For MPD

Note: This was originally made specifically for my PC, but I plan on editing this to work for anyone.

**Warning: This is very insecure. It runs system commands a lot, and is recommended to be ran on a local server without internet access.**

For the lyrics to work currently, you have to have the lyrics in a folder called "lyrics" in the root folder of the server. Then the lyrics for the song have to be in a txt document labelled "artist - title.txt". Basically, if you use ncmpcpp as you music player, you can copy "$HOME/.lyrics" to your root folder and rename it to "lyrics".

Also, sorry for my terrible looking script. Just started out with PHP in this project for the first time.
