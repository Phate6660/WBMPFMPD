# Web-Based Music Player For MPD

**Warning: This is very insecure. It runs system commands a lot, and is recommended to be ran on a local server without internet access.**

Note: This was originally made specifically for my PC, but I plan on editing this to work for anyone.

Also Note: Due to a bug in the way my divs are formatted, I recommend clicking the album cover first thing after loading the page. To make the lyrics nice and center.

For the lyrics to work currently, you have to have the lyrics in a folder called "lyrics" in the root folder of the server. Then the lyrics for the song have to be in a txt document labelled "artist - title.txt". Basically, if you use ncmpcpp as you music player, you can copy "$HOME/.lyrics" to your root folder and rename it to "lyrics".

Also, sorry for my terrible looking script. Just started out with PHP in this project for the first time.

By the way, if anyone has suggestions for this little project, please feel free to suggest away. I will most likely implement it.
